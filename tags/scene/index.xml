      <description>Welcome to my virtual assistant project Before going deeply let me explain what is a virtual assistant in reality? A virtual assistant is an independent contactor who provides administrative services to clients while operating outside of the client&amp;rsquo;s office. A virtual assistant typically operates from a home office but can access the necessary planning documents, such as shared calendars, remotely.
The specific duties of a virtual assistant vary according to the needs of the client and the terms of the contract.</description>
